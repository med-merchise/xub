# xub - Tools and documentation to configure Linux-based workstations

## Getting Started

Read the documentation in order to learn how to install foundation and
common-systems tools and applications.  Also you can follow the step by step
process of configuring your system.

### Prospects for project folder names

- `bin`: executable scripts that can be run directly from the command line.
- `data`: original copies of raw data.
- `docs`: project documentation.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks (interactive web application for creating and
  sharing computational documents).
- `rc`: resource configuration to configure the shell environment.
- `src`: package source code.
- `tests`: unit tests and integration tests for the code.
- `opt`: for optional packages that are not part of the default distribution.
