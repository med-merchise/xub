## Installing Python

Most Linux distributions come with Python installed by default.  If your
operating system does not have it installed by default, see the official site
for [Python Downloads][pydl], or see this [guide][pyi-guide] on how to install
Python on your system.  We use [](#python/uv) to manage other Python versions
and dependencies for almost all projects.
